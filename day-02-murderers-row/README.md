# Day 02 — Murderers Row

Placeholder site. Add your content in `src/data.js` tomorrow.

## Deploy to Vercel

1. In Vercel: **Add New Project** → Import your `black-history-month` GitHub repo (same repo as day-01).
2. **Root Directory:** Click Edit and set to `day-02-murderers-row`.
3. **Framework Preset:** Vite (auto-detected).
4. Deploy.

Your day-01 project uses the repo root and a root `vercel.json`. This day-02 project uses its own folder as the root—each Vercel project points at a different directory.
