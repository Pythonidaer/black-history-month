  intro: {
    body: [
      'Nina Simone (1933–2003) was a pianist, singer-songwriter, and activist whose work fused classical technique with the emotional force of gospel, blues, folk, and soul. Often labeled a jazz vocalist, she resisted narrow categories and insisted on the seriousness of her training and intent.',
      'Her performances and songs were closely associated with the civil rights era, with many works addressing racial inequality and reflecting the political and social conditions of the time.',

        title: 'Growing Up',
        body: 'Born Eunice Kathleen Waymon in Tryon, North Carolina, Nina Simone was raised in a religious household where music and discipline were central. A prodigious pianist, she played publicly as a child and pursued formal classical study with the goal of becoming a concert pianist. That ambition—and the barriers placed in its way—shaped the artist she became: technically exacting, emotionally uncompromising, and unwilling to separate art from reality.',

        title: 'Early Life and Classical Foundation',
        body: [
          'Simone began playing piano as a very young child and performed in church and community settings. Local supporters and benefactors funded her lessons, recognizing her talent early. A formative experience came during a childhood recital when her parents were forced to move seats due to segregation; she refused to play until they were allowed back to the front—an early act of public resistance that stayed with her.',
          'Her training emphasized classical repertoire, including the works of Johann Sebastian Bach, whose structure and precision would remain audible in her phrasing and arrangements throughout her career.',

        title: 'The Door That Closed',
        body: 'After excelling academically, Simone pursued elite music training—studying at Juilliard and preparing for admission to the Curtis Institute of Music. She was denied entry to Curtis, and she believed the rejection was rooted in racial discrimination. That moment became a personal and political turning point: the loss of a classical career pathway did not end her ambition, but it redirected her voice into public life—where she would challenge power through performance.',

        title: 'Becoming "Nina Simone"',
        body: [
          'To fund continued study and private lessons, she worked as a pianist in clubs and bars and was required to sing as well. To keep this work from her religious family, she adopted the stage name Nina Simone. In these venues, her signature style emerged: classical discipline fused with jazz harmony, blues feeling, gospel intensity, and a commanding vocal presence.',
          'Her debut album Little Girl Blue helped establish her as a major new talent, and her recording of "I Loves You, Porgy" brought mainstream attention—while she continued to view herself, first and foremost, as a serious musician.',

        title: 'Civil Rights Era and Cultural Activism',
        body: [
          'In the early 1960s, Simone\'s recordings and public activity increasingly addressed racial inequality. She appeared at civil-rights rallies and benefit events, including the "Stars for Freedom" gathering in Montgomery, concerts supporting organizations such as CORE and SNCC, and appearances connected to the Selma voting-rights marches.',
          'This engagement intensified after the 1963 Birmingham church bombing and the assassination of Medgar Evers. In response, she wrote "Mississippi Goddam" (1964), one of her first explicitly political compositions. The song condemned racial violence and frustration with gradual reform, became closely associated with protest culture, and faced backlash and bans in several southern states.',
          'Throughout the decade, Simone continued performing and speaking publicly on issues of inequality, using her repertoire to engage directly with contemporary social conditions and departing from expectations that performers remain politically neutral.',

        title: 'What She Built Through Music',
        body: [
          'Alongside "Mississippi Goddam," works from this period include "Four Women," which explored identity and stereotype through narrative portraits; "To Be Young, Gifted, and Black," written in tribute to Lorraine Hansberry and centered on affirmation for younger generations; and "Why? (The King of Love Is Dead)," performed in the aftermath of Martin Luther King Jr.\'s assassination and reflecting public mourning. These recordings demonstrate how Simone translated contemporary events and social conditions into widely circulated music that resonated with audiences during the decade.',
          'Across these recordings, Simone connected specific historical events to narrative and musical form. Rather than isolating political material from artistic practice, she integrated it directly into composition, arrangement, and performance. This approach positioned her catalog as part of the broader cultural record of the decade, documenting public grief, identity formation, and social tension through widely circulated recordings.',
          'The impact of this work extended beyond the immediate moment. These compositions remained part of her repertoire, were reinterpreted across performances and recordings, and continued shaping public understanding of her artistic role. Together, they illustrate how Simone\'s output during this period established thematic foundations that informed her later work and reception.',

        title: 'Artistic Identity and Genre Refusal',
        body: [
          'Simone\'s career is often misread through genre labels. She was marketed as jazz, embraced by soul audiences, performed folk interpretations, and played with classical architecture. But she resisted reduction. Her insistence on craft and seriousness challenged the way Black artists—especially Black women—were expected to be categorized, marketed, and contained.',
          'Her music showed that "genre" is often less about sound than about power: who gets granted artistic complexity, and who gets boxed in.',

        title: 'Later Life',
        body: 'Over time, Simone\'s relationship with the U.S. music industry grew more strained, and she spent long periods living outside the United States—across the Caribbean, Africa, and Europe—before ultimately settling in France. Despite shifts in popularity, she continued recording and performing for decades. Her later recognition included renewed public interest in her catalog, memoir publication (I Put a Spell on You), and institutional acknowledgments that arrived long after the doors first closed on her early classical ambitions.',

        body: 'Nina Simone died on April 21, 2003, at her home in Carry-le-Rouet, France, after several years living with breast cancer. She was 70. By then she had spent decades performing internationally and was widely recognized as both a recording artist and a cultural and political figure. Her passing coincided with renewed institutional recognition—including an honorary degree from the Curtis Institute of Music in 2003, the same institution that had rejected her decades earlier—reflecting a broader reassessment of her contributions.',

          'Simone\'s body of work holds an established place in music history and cultural scholarship, and her recordings and compositions remain reference points in discussions of the civil rights era, twentieth-century American music, and the political role of performance. Her fusion of classical technique with jazz, blues, gospel, and folk influenced later performers including Lauryn Hill, Alicia Keys, and John Legend, while her recordings have been covered or sampled by artists ranging from Jeff Buckley and Muse to Kanye West—evidence of continued stylistic and interpretive impact. Her catalog has been repeatedly reissued, covered, sampled, and reinterpreted, incorporated into academic study and media, and maintained within performance repertoires and recording archives—ensuring her music remains an active presence in contemporary culture.',
